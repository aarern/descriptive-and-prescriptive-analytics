# Descriptive-and-prescriptive-analytics
BA 3551 (Business Analytics Tools)

The following is an upload of my business analytics labs. The labs cover topics in descriptive analytics (association rules [Apriori Algorithm], cluster analysis [Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means]), and predictive analytics (Classification [K-NN, Decision Trees], Numeric Prediction [K-NN, Regression Trees]).

These tools could be used for finding patterns in consumer data (Association Rules), identifying consumer segments (Cluster Analysis), predicting if your product will be bought by a particular consumer (Classification), or pricing optimization (Numeric Prediction).
