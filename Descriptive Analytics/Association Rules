########## Lab questions start here ##########

# Question 1
# 1.1
# Inspect the first 10 transactions
inspect(head(movie_data, 10))

# 1.2
# Get a general summary of the data
summary(movie_data)

# 1.3
# Dataset information: 999 rows, most frequent movie: StarWars.EpisodeIV.ANewHope.1977., 
# Average movies watched per viewer: 18.42

# Question 2
# 2.1
# Support percentage and count of each unique movie
itemFrequency(movie_data)
round(itemFrequency(movie_data), 3)
itemFrequency(movie_data, type = "absolute")

# 2.2
# Plot the top 20 most frequent movies
itemFrequencyPlot(movie_data, ylim = c(0, 1), 
                  main = "Support %", col = "steelblue3", topN = 20,
                  cex.names = 0.6)

# 2.3
# Support percentage for a favorite movie
itemFrequency(movie_data)["StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."]

# 2.4
# Subset transactions by movie and inspect
subset(movie_data, items %in% c("StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."))
inspect(head(subset(movie_data, items %in% c("StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."))))

# Question 3
# 3.1
# Find association rules using Apriori algorithm
mean(itemFrequency(movie_data))
median(itemFrequency(movie_data))
rules <- apriori(movie_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.55, conf = 0.55, target = "rules", minlen = 2))

# 3.2
# Summary and inspection of the rules
summary(rules)
inspect(rules)

# 3.3
# Top 10 rules by lift and confidence
inspect(head(rules, by = "lift", n = 10))
inspect(head(rules, by = "confidence", n = 10))

# 3.4
# Rules involving your favorite movie
inspect(subset(rules, lhs %in% "StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."))
inspect(subset(rules, rhs %in% "StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."))

# Question 4
# 4.1
# Apriori for rules with your favorite movie
rules2 <- apriori(movie_data, parameter=list (supp=0.55, conf = 0.55, minlen = 2), appearance = list (lhs="StarWars.EpisodeV.TheEmpireStrikesBack.1980."))

# 4.2
# Sort and inspect the rules by lift
inspect(sort(rules2, by = "lift"))

# 4.3
# Plot rules as a scatterplot with color based on confidence
inspectDT(rules2)
plot(rules2, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")

# 4.4
# Recommend a movie based on the rules
# Based on the lift of 1.11, confidence of 1.0, and support of 0.85, viewers would watch StarWars.EpisodeIV.ANewHope.1977.next.
