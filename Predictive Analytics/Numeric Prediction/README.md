# Numeric Prediction

In this project, we used data about cereal nutrition to train a model that predicts cereal ratings. 
We worked with features like calories, protein, fat, sugar, and more to predict how well each cereal would be rated. 
First, we cleaned up the data, split it into training and testing sets, and standardized the features. 
Then, we used k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) to predict the ratings and checked how well it did using error metrics like Mean Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and Root Mean Squared Error. 
These metrics helped us spot any outliers and get a sense of how accurate the model was. 
We also trained a Regression Tree to see how different factors like sugar or calories affected the ratings, and plotted it to visualize the predictions. 
Finally, we compared the two models and looked at the results to decide which one worked better for predicting cereal ratings.
